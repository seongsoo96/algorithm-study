Introduction

We may access a random element by index in Array.
However, we might want to restrict the processing order in some cases.

In this card, we introduce two different processing orders,
Frist-in-Frist-out and Last-in-First-out and its two corresponding linear data structures,
Queue and Stack.

We go through the definition, implementation and built-in functions for each data structure.
Then,  we focus more on the practical applications of these two data structures.
