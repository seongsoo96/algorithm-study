<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
    We may access a random element by index in Array.
    However, we might want to restrict the processing order in some cases.

    In this card, we introduce two different processing orders,
    Frist-in-Frist-out and Last-in-First-out and its two corresponding linear data structures,
    Queue and Stack.

    We go through the definition, implementation and built-in functions for each data structure.
    Then, we focus more on the practical applications of these two data structures.

<h1>Queue: Frist-in-frist-out Data Structure(FIFO)</h1>

<p>
    In this chapter, we will first introduce First-in-first-out (FIFO)
    and how it works in a queue.
